# CryptoKeySecure

## Introduction
CryptoKeySecure is an open source python-based app developed to monitor and manage secure private-public key encryption for safely storing a wide variety of items. It utilizes libraries such as cryptography and matplotlib for visualizing data, as well as encryption methods such as RSA and ECDSA within native python code. It is a powerful tool for providing users with the highest levels of secure file storage.

## Goals
- Create a secure Python app to monitor and store secure public-private key encryption
- Utilize modern cryptography libraries for encrypting and visualizing data
- Implement methods for encryption such as RSA and ECDSA
- Develop a beautiful and functional code base
- Provide capabilities to build upon and extend the power of the program
- Create a useful toolset to help corporations and individuals elevate their cyersecurity protocols 
- Generate code shorter than 100 lines if possible 
- Include a copyright with the author name 'CY83R-3X71NC710N' and the year 2023

## Installation
In order to get the CryptoKeySecure app up and running, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the source code [here](https://github.com/CY83R-3X71NC710N/CryptoKeySecure)
2. Ensure you have Python 3.5.3 or newer installed
3. Install any necessary libraries as listed in the requirements.txt file
4. Change any URLs or Keys as necessary to run on your own machine
5. Run app.py

## API
The CryptoKeySecure application utilizes a combination of closed and open source APIs. The closed source APIs are a work in progress and will not be released to the public due to licensing agreements. Therefore, the user is encouraged to create open source alternatives to any of these closed-source APIs.

## Warning!
This application is only a prototype and still needs some work before it can be fully functional. As a result, URLs and keys, as well as other components, may need to be updated to work on the reader's respective machine. Note that this is a work in progress and more capabilities may be added over time as the project developers and contributors continue to build upon the program.
